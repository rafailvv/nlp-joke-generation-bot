# Short Description and Motivation

The Joke Generation Bot (Decoder based transformer) is a natural language processing tool as a part of an NLP course at the university. The bot generates hilarious and witty jokes from a random seed, making use of natural language processing techniques to analyze the semantics of the input and produce humorous content. The motivation behind creating this bot is to demonstrate the capabilities of natural language processing, while providing an amusing and engaging experience for users. With its ability to produce unique and diverse jokes, the Joke Generation Bot is a prime example of how AI can be used to enhance our daily lives in ways that were previously unimaginable.
